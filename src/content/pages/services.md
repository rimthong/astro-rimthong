# How can I help?

With extensive experience in the technology sector, I have collaborated with both established institutions and dynamic startups. My expertise spans a diverse range of areas, including developing Minimum Viable Products (MVPs), coaching high-performance teams, and guiding Series A startups through SOC-2 preparation. It would be my privilege to extend my knowledge and skills to support your endeavors. Feel free to connect with me via [email](mailto:rimthong@gmail.com?subject=Consult), on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/rimthong), or schedule a complimentary [introductory consultation](https://calendly.com/arimthong/30min) to explore how I can assist you.

## Strategic Advising / Fractional CTO Services

Navigating challenging phases in your startup's journey requires both strategic and tactical wisdom. Whether you're deciding between various technologies or seeking validation for your engineering product roadmap, I can provide invaluable insights and experience at a fraction of the cost of a full-time CTO.

## Coaching and Mentorship

Elevate your engineering management skills or seek career guidance with my personalized coaching and mentorship services. Whether you're dealing with complex engineering challenges, seeking career advice, or looking to provide your team with individualized mentorship, I'm here to facilitate your growth and success.

## Auditing Security and Compliance

In an era where security and privacy are paramount, ensuring your startup's resilience against data breaches is critical. I offer comprehensive audits of your product and practices, ensuring robust security and compliance. This includes preparing your startup for dealing with enterprise clients, guiding you through SOC-2 certification, and navigating complex security policies and questionnaires.

## Recruitment and Talent Acquisition

Expanding your team or filling key positions such as Lead Engineers or VP of Engineering requires a discerning eye. Leverage my experience in evaluating candidates across various levels, from interns to CTOs, to ensure you make informed decisions based on a candidate's technical acumen, soft skills, and potential red flags.

## Project Development and MVP Creation

Ready to bring your project to fruition quickly and efficiently? Contact me to discuss your specifications, and I will either personally develop your MVP or assemble a team capable of delivering it with excellence.
