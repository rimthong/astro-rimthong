As a results-driven Engineering leader and seasoned Software Engineer, I bring over 15 years of experience to the table, encompassing a wide spectrum of capabilities. I excel in building award-winning MVPs and crafting winning RFP responses, consistently driving business success. My leadership style emphasizes empathy and collaboration, enabling me to grow and align distributed and local teams with company strategy. I thrive at the intersection of cutting-edge technology, security, and management trends, blending technical prowess with exceptional communication skills to address complex challenges.

> Whether as an Engineering leader in your team, or fractional CTO, I am your strategic partner for achieving excellence in software development, security, and team leadership.

When not working, I enjoy sharing my thoughts and passions about coaching, software engineering, security, startups, food, fermentation and fitness!
